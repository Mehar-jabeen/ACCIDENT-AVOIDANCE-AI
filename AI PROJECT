The aim is to create a accident avoidence AI


IDEA:
MY idea is to create a detector using artificial intelligence 
by applying the techniques in autonomous vehicles .


Background:
 The main cause for the idea is accidents that i come across while travelling which are frustrating.
 we are going to attach this detector with camera infront of the four wheelers or heavy engine vehicles

Data and AI techniques: 
  thechniques used here is image recognition , speed detection .
  
How is it used:
   This can be used to avoid accidents and prevent from accidents.
   Image recognition in this is used to detect the vehicle in the opposite and the spped detector will detect the speed of the vehicle.
  
Challenges:
    since this is an AI it has its limitations
    it should be implemented in all four wheelers to prevent accidents otherwise this will not be effective.
What next:
   since i have designed this in a particular way by focusing on the front side 
   it can be futher developed to other sides too
